<h2 id="project-details">üìù Project Details</h2>

<b>Title</b>: Improve tests for all REST API endpoints

<b>Overview</b>:
This work strengthens the SW360 REST layer by adding comprehensive integration tests across all resource controllers, covering CRUD flows, pagination, filtering, sorting, attachments, relationships, negative/error paths, and authorization-sensitive routes. The suite is built on Spring Boot‚Äôs TestRestTemplate and mocks for service boundaries where appropriate, and it produces JaCoCo coverage reports to guide future improvements. Repository: [eclipse-sw360/sw360](https://github.com/eclipse-sw360/sw360). Tests live under `rest/resource-server/src/test/java/.../integration`.

<b>Goals</b>:
- Add tests for all endpoints across controllers using the existing Java/Spring/Maven stack.
- Improve coverage by exercising multiple scenarios per endpoint (success, invalid, empty, and auth/error cases).
- Establish a baseline coverage report with JaCoCo; next step: surface coverage in GitHub Actions.

<h2 id="milestones">üèÅ Milestones</h2>

Derived from the implemented test classes (SpecTest ‚Üí Test), grouped logically.

- Core domain
  - Projects: end‚Äëto‚Äëend CRUD, search and filters, links, attachments, license clearing, SBOM import, reports
  - Components: listing, field selection, updates, merge/split, attachments, relationships
  - Releases: retrieval, search, attachments, usedBy, subscriptions, SPDX licenses, relationships, Fossology triggers
  - Users: tokens and profile APIs
- Supporting domain
  - Vendors: CRUD, search, releases, merge, exports
  - Packages: CRUD, complex search, relationships
  - Licenses/LicenseTypes/Obligations: CRUD, imports/exports, obligations links, whitelist
- Governance & workflows
  - Moderation Requests: list/byState/mySubmissions, validate, delete
  - Clearing Requests: lifecycle + comments
  - Change Logs: document change history
- Platform & infra
  - Schedule: schedule/unschedule/status for background jobs
  - Health: health readiness checks
  - Configurations: get/update, containers
  - Database Sanitation: duplicate search
  - Import/Export: templates, uploads, downloads
  - ECC: CRUD
  - Search: global search
  - Attachments: by SHA/download/upload

<h2 id="contributions">üöÄ Contributions</h2>

- Added comprehensive integration tests for 21 areas of the REST API.
- Covered CRUD, pagination, filtering, sorting, relationships, attachments, and negative/error cases.
- Produced JaCoCo coverage; next step: publish coverage via GitHub Actions.

<b>Per‚Äëcontroller endpoint coverage (examples; non‚Äëexhaustive)</b>

- Components (`/api/components`): list, get, patch, delete, mycomponents, mySubscriptions, recentComponents, searchByExternalIds, attachments (POST/DELETE/download), merge/split, `{id}/releases`, `{id}/vulnerabilities`.
- Releases (`/api/releases`): list, get (single/batch), usedBy, attachments (POST/GET/DELETE), recentReleases, search, externalId, subscriptions, SPDX licenses, transitive releases, checkCyclicLink, vulnerability links, Fossology triggers/status.

- Vendors (`/api/vendors`): CRUD, releases, mergeVendors, exportVendorDetails.
- Vulnerabilities (`/api/vulnerabilities`): CRUD, trackingStatus, releaseVulnerabilityRelation, delete release links; negative CVE cases.
- Licenses/LicenseTypes/Obligations: license CRUD/imports/uploads/whitelist, licenseTypes list/get, obligations CRUD + batch get.
- Moderation Requests: list/byState/mySubmissions, validate, delete.
- Clearing Requests: lifecycle and comments.
- Configurations: get/update, container operations.
- Department: import scheduling, path configuration, logs and log content, members.
- Import/Export: component/release templates and links, users export, uploads, componentAttachment uploads.
- Schedule: schedule/unschedule/status endpoints for multiple services.
- ECC, Health, Search, DatabaseSanitation, Attachments: CRUD and utilities as present in tests.

<b>Coverage reporting</b>: JaCoCo configured locally; next step is to publish coverage in CI (GitHub Actions) and surface deltas per package.

<h2 id="takeaways">üìö Key Takeaways</h2>

- Balanced full‚Äëtime work with consistent GSoC progress; improved time management.
- Practiced clean, maintainable Java test design and refactoring.
- Improved communication and collaboration with mentors/community.
- Deepened understanding of SW360 domain and REST testing patterns.
- Built reliable data seeding and mocking patterns across controllers.
- Strengthened debugging skills for flakiness and environment issues.

<h3>Challenges and how they were addressed</h3>

- Environment setup and realistic data preparation: standardized fixtures and helper utilities.
- Debugging failing tests across modules: isolated boundaries with mocks and added targeted assertions.
- Maximizing coverage with meaningful scenarios: expanded negative/auth cases and relationship paths.
